Write a function:
 that, given a positive integer N  However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word

- If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers:2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order.
